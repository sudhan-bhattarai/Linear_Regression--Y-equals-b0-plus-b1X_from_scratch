It is a simple linear regression with one input and one output variable.
Developing an algorithm from scratch is beneficial to understand the mathematics behind it.
But for the rapid experimentations, it is a time-consuming practice especially when there are many open-source libraries available (ex: scikit-learn).
Two codes in this repo are used for:
### 1. Developing the LR from scratch with statistical regression (least squares) formula.
### 2. Developing the LR from scratch with Gradient Descent method.
